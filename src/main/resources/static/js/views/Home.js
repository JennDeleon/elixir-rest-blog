                A man goes to work one day to discover that he could not log on to his computer. His password won't work. Then he remembers that the passwords are reset every month for security reasons. So he goes to his boss's office and had this conversation:
                <br>
                Man: "Hey, boss, my password is out of date."
                <br>
                Boss: "Yes. The password is different, but if you listen carefully you can figure out the new password. It has the
                <br>
                same number of letters as your old one, but only 4 of the letters are the same."
                Man: "Thanks, boss!"
                <br>
                The man then goes to his computer and logs on successfully. Question: What is his new password, and what was the old one?
